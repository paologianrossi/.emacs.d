* Email
  Email in Emacs!

  This is disabled by default as it requires a bunch of dependencies
  and we don't really use it everywhere.

  Uncomment the line in the block to enable.

  Configuration for editing text (as opposed to source code editing) has its own config file [[file:text-mode.org::*Text%20Modes%20configuration][here]].

* Python-mode
  For Python, I use Elpy.  I think I will make this myself (getting
  inspired from elpy and friends), to refactor out
  programming-related configs into a more generic, reusable file.
