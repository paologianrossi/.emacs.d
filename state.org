* Keeping state
** Backup files and autosave
   Emacs backs everything up.  By default, backup files are those
   annoying suffixed-in-~ files you find in the original file's
   directory.  Here we configure backups to be better behaved than
   default, without disabling them as they're actually pretty useful.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq
      backup-directory-alist `(("." . ,(expand-file-name
                                        (concat user-emacs-directory "backups"))))
      backup-by-copying t
      delete-old-versions t
      kept-new-versions 20
      kept-old-versions 2
      vc-make-backup-files t
      version-control t)
   #+end_src

   Auto-saves are a totally different beast.  They're even more useful
   than backups when it hits the fan.  Since they are not to be used
   by humans, we store them in =var-dir=.  Also, we trigger a backup
   every time we autosave, and set some sensible thresholds for autosaving.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq
      auto-save-list-file-prefix (expand-file-name "aut-save-list/.saves-" var-dir)
      auto-save-timeout 10
      auto-save-interval 300)

     (add-hook 'auto-save-hook (lambda () (setq buffer-backed-up nil)))
   #+end_src

** Save places
   - Remember where we left off for each file.  When we reopen the file, bring us to the right place.
     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (require 'saveplace)
       (setq-default save-place t)
       (setq save-place-file (expand-file-name "saved-places" var-dir))
     #+end_src

** Auto-reverting
   - If a file changes on disk, refresh it in emacs too.
     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (global-auto-revert-mode 1)
     #+end_src
